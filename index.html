            Someone being patient with you is one of the softest forms of love, and you showed me that time and again, even though you're no saint;) 
            I always wondered how is it that you seem to be able to read me like an open book while I'm sometimes so clueless about you. And I realized that all I had to do was let myself be vulnerable coz the walls didn't mean anything anyway, and that I had to be present in the relationship, and not live one out in my head. 
            I could write books worth of letters, saying things, expressing gratitude or sorrow, apologizing and rejoicing but none of that would mean anything without any substantial backing up. I think we both know why I'm writing this, yet chances of me being able to say it are slim.
            I don't know what we are rn, or maybe I'm just trying to avoid the truth. 
            Are we on some sort of a break? Ex-with-benefits? What do you want from me? The sad part is I'd probably be okay with any of it, because when I said I'd rather fight with you all day than listen to sweetnothings from anyone else, I meant it, and I still do. 
            I do miss telling you about my boring days or recounting my arguments with my overly dramatic family, but what i miss infinitely times more is your laughter, your passionate arguments about literally anything. I miss you being a drama queen or the cocky arrogant person who refuses to accept he could be wrong(which, its a shame to admit, more often than not you are not :/ )
            I miss the warmth and comfort and all the good things, true…. But what I miss the most is you…just being you. Your stories & your philosophy talks…yourTears and snot, smiles and laugh, grumpy or annoyed…everything.
            I miss having you as a part of my life, and I miss being a part of yours.
            so...can i be the Phil to your Claire? (You've watched the Modern Family, so I think you'll understand why I inter-changed the characters.)
            I don't want to go into the past or future because what's done is done, and we never know what might happen the next day.
            I know i made our ride together a really bumpy one, and you got hurt, a lot(even tho you added a few of your own as well) but can we please not go our separate ways? I am not ready for that…I don't know if I ever will be. I can ask for forgiveness again and again but I'd rather spend the rest of my life making it up to you than just saying a million apologies.
            I know this might make you even more angry/upset/something more than you already are. But I feel like I'm a little out of options, and even though I would've preferred to do this in-person, I didn't think coming to see you was a great idea, as I had a strong feeling you wouldn't have left even your campus(idk why you always said I wouldn't come to see you coz…while I'm here and you're in Pilani, all you really had to do was…Ask)
            If you don't bring this up even once, I'll take it as a no, and we can pretend this never happened, and I'll play along because… 
            You said to you I am the “accumulation of 2 years worth of depression” and I don't know if I can explain how that feels but… I'd rather take a bullet than add another day to it…because idk what you or anyone else believes, I really do wish you all the happiness, with or without me."></textarea><br>
